			"title": "Restrict direct memory access",
			"description": "Follow these instructions to protect memory against unauthorized direct memory access (DMA):\n\n- Inspect the circuit board to identify interfaces that provide DMA to external components. For example, Thunderbolt, PC Card, ExpressCard, and FireWire.\n- Disable such interfaces in production if it is possible and they are not needed.\n    - One solution is to disable these interfaces in BIOS and protect the BIOS configurations with a strong password.\n- If not possible, design the device considering the fact that the device memory is accessible. For example, do not load any secret that is not particular to the device or the user (e.g. shared secrets of the organization, master keys, issuer keys, etc.) to the memory. Attackers have infinite time to explore the device and extract such data."

			"description": "Follow these instructions to verify that memory is protected against unauthorized direct memory access (DMA):\n\n1. Inspect the circuit board to identify interfaces that provide DMA to external components. For example, Thunderbolt, PC Card, ExpressCard, and FireWire.\n2. Attempt connecting to such interfaces using proper hardware devices. If you are able to attach to and access memory addresses successfully, this test fails.\n3. Verify that any secret not particular to the device or the user (e.g., shared secrets of the organization, master keys, issuer keys, etc.) are never loaded into the memory."
