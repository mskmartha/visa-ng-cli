         "vulnerabilityDescription":"The program copies data to a destination buffer without verifying the bounds of the buffer. If the size of the destination buffer is less than the size of the data the copy operation can lead to a buffer overflow. Alternatively, a buffer underflow can result if a pointer to the destination buffer moves past its starting memory location during a copy operation.\nThe simplest type of error, and the most common cause of buffer overflows, is the \"classic\" case in which the program copies into a buffer without checking its length at all. Many other variants exist, however, all of them will lead to corruption of the program's memory, possibly overwriting sensitive data and code.",
